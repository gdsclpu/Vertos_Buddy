**Vertos Buddy**

<b> Problem Statement: </b>

We often hear the expression “think globally, act locally”. So, we have started thinking about our local problems so that we can build a project. We discovered a huge gap of interaction between our college management system and its students and faculty staff on a ground level.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

The university management project "Vertos Buddy" aims to ensure that an app can respond to every student anytime like a buddy and that influences the information system and minimises the wastage of time.


<b> Project Description: </b>
Technology plays an important part in our day-to-day routines, resulting in significant changes in many sectors of work, with Mobile Application being among the most significant advances. Because, mobile applications are extensively utilised and are recognised for their ease of use, they may be utilised efficiently for this job. 
This project proposes a University Academics and Management System to keep track of the various apps and websites of the university  at one place.

<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

- The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students select their route bus and track its location. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app : 
- Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
- RecyclerView : To present the list of different route busses we used the efficient recyclerview.
Google Maps API : We are also using the Google Maps API free version for  below 1000 users. In future if the user base increases we will go for the upgraded plan too.
- LiveData & Room Database : We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the Bus driver's locations received from their mobile at real time and update it to local databases using Room. Coordinates are then updated in the bus route screen and students can track their route bus locations.

<b> Challenges we face : </b>
How to plan a project and complete a working real life project is always a matter of challenge. We used many tech tools for the first time. The most challenging task was to collect the data from the database of the university but it was done completely in collaboration with the university.
